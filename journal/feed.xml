Zero Art Movement
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/journal/img/20151227_zero.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt tag&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an interesting coincidence that my first post is about &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_(art&amp;#41;'&gt;Zero&lt;/a&gt;, the art movement raised after second world war to initialize a new beginning. Actually, I have similar feelings for my life and career with the idea of this art, thus, it was an fascinating activity to see the prominent pieces at &lt;a href='http://www.sakipsabancimuzesi.org/en'&gt;SabancÄ± Museum&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, it was interesting to see how artists used vibration, light, space, soot, nail, and other metarials to express their feelings. Although the movement is extremely modern, abstract, and too hard to understand, I enjoyed visiting the museum accompanied with a guide. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/134530188@N05/albums/72157662247203840/with/23380385513/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an album of the pieces from my camera. &lt;/p&gt;
